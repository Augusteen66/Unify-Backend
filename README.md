# Unify-Backend

## Problem Statement

In the year 2020 we witnessed a global pandemic, forest fires, earthquakes and what not. The sudden lock down also brought an unprecedented hunger crisis. These crisis showed that we still have to become a long way to go.
In this day and age the purpose of social media networks is to bring the world together but studies show that people often feel more desolated, rather than connected. There is a need to have a social media network which will connect the people who are willing to work for the social cause, interested to contribute for sustainable growth of the society.
Unify is the social platform where people come together for social service cause and make their contribution towards sustainable growth of the society.

## Our Solution

To take care of the unprecedented hunger crisis, environmental issues, the lack of teachers for the specially abled and other unpredictable issues which can be easily solved by the unification of like minded individuals, we built,  Unify, a native application which will connect the like minded individuals who are willing to work for their causes.

Our app is divided into three sections, namely - 

### Aaharam -  
Around 67 million tons of food is wasted in India every year which has been valued at around Rs.92,000 crores. 
Our application will link the restaurants, events or even households with leftover food with the NGOs and volunteers. 
So instead of throwing the food, they can connect with NGOs and Volunteers by registering for the drive, donate the food to them who will deliver to underprivileged.

### Paryavarana - 
Paryavarana provides an platform where people or organizations can come togather to address  environmental issues.
Users can register for the programs which are initiated by other users , volunteering groups or organisations.
The platform allows user to host an environmental program in which other users can work as volunteer. 

### AdhyƒÅpana -

Unify provides the platform which will give you an opportunity to educate the society.
A User can join the platform as  teacher. 
The User will have to fill the volunteering form. This volunteering-form will be submitted to a centralised platform where all NGOs  can shortlist the volunteers on the basis of their requirement, through the list of volunteers.
Once review is completed, an acknowledgement  will  be send to user by the NGO. 
If User is selected, He/She can coordinate with NGOs to complete further formalities.
